# ERC-20 Token and Decentralized Exchange
This repository contains the source code for an ERC-20 token and a decentralized exchange (DEX) implemented in Solidity, along with a JavaScript front-end application for visualizing the contract and providing a user interface.


## Features
- ERC-20 Token: The project includes an implementation of an ERC-20 token contract, which adheres to the standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can transfer and manage balances of this token.
- Decentralized Exchange: The DEX contract allows users to exchange the ERC-20 token with Ether (ETH) and vice versa. The exchange functionality is decentralized, meaning it operates directly on the blockchain without relying on centralized intermediaries.
- Fee Structure: The exchange charges a small fee for each transaction, providing a cost-efficient alternative to regular centralized exchanges. Users can save on fees while securely exchanging tokens and ETH.
- Liquidity Provision: Users have the option to provide liquidity to the DEX by depositing both the ERC-20 token and ETH into the liquidity pool. In return, they receive a share of the transaction fees generated by the exchange. This incentivizes liquidity providers and enables them to earn profits.

## Repository Structure
- `contracts/intercases`: Contains the Solidity smart contract files.
- `token.sol`: Implements the ERC-20 token functionality.
- `exchange.sol`: Implements the DEX functionality, including token and ETH exchange, fee calculation, and liquidity provision.
- `web_app/`: Includes the JavaScript front-end application for interacting with the smart contracts and visualizing the DEX contract.

## Prerequisite
- Node.js / NPM

## Getting Started
To run and test the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mykhailo-Sichkaruk/DEX`
- Chamge directory `cd DEX`
- Run `npx hardhat node` to create a local node. If the node starts successfully, you should see the following message in your terminal: "Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at https://localhost:8545."
- Run in new terminal `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy_token.js` to compile and deploy your token contract. Upon success, you should see the message: "Finished writing token contract address: ...".
- Run `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy_exchange.js` to deploy the exchange contract. Upon success, you should see the message: "Finished writing exchange contract address: ...".
- Open `webapp/index.html` in you favorite browser.l free to modify and distribute the code according to the terms of the license.
